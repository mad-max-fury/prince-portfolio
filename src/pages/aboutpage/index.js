            My name is Prince Chijioke Ugbuta a User Experience Designer
            passionate about building easy-to-use, user-friendly, and profitable
            digital products while solving usersâ€™ needs. <br />
            <br />
            My love for learning and quest for knowledge fueled my engagement
            with the prestigious Genesys Tech Hub where I successfully completed
            an intensive six months internship program. At Genesys, I learned
            more about collaboration in an agile development team. <br />
            <br />
            Over the years I have collaborated with different teams across the
            globe designing digital solutions in the fintech industry,
            blockchain industry, ecommerce industry, and lots more with a high
            understanding of usability. I have also explored blockchain
            technology and designed several experiences for web3 projects.
            <br />
            <br />
            When I am not designing on Figma, I design graphics in photoshop,
            develop WordPress websites, and share my ideas on my blog and design
            communities to aid beginners to learn.
